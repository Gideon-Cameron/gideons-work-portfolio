          I am a Frontend Developer, specializing in creating engaging,
          responsive, and user-friendly websites. While I have a solid
          background in full stack development, my true focus lies in crafting
          seamless user interfaces that enhance the way people interact with
          technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked as a freelance developer on various
          frontend projects, where I honed my skills. More recently, I
          contributed to a language learning module, taking on both frontend and
          full stack responsibilities, integrating technologies like Node.js,
          MongoDB, and Express.js to deliver dynamic, full-featured applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          I enjoy the challenge of turning complex problems into simple, elegant
          solutions. Collaboration, learning, and attention to detail are at the
          core of my development process.
